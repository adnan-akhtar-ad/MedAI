      "AI Response: Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It often causes whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples, and mainly affects the face, forehead, chest, upper back, and shoulders. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it can affect people of all ages. While it's not a serious health threat, severe acne can cause emotional distress and lead to scarring.  To prevent acne, it's recommended to: 1. Cleanse the skin gently with a mild soap or cleanser twice a day. 2. Avoid picking or squeezing pimples, as this can lead to infection and scarring. 3. Keep hair clean and away from the face. 4. Avoid excessive sun exposure and use non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) skin care products and makeup. 5. In some cases, over-the-counter or prescription medications may be necessary to manage acne.  If you're experiencing persistent or severe acne, it's best to consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for proper evaluation and treatment.  Please note that this advice is based on general knowledge and may not apply to your specific situation. Always consult a medical professional for personalized advice.\n"
