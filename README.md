## End-to-End Medical Chatbot using Generative AI

🏥 AI-Powered Medical Chatbot 🤖💬
📌 Description
This AI-powered medical chatbot is designed to provide retrieval-based medical assistance by answering health-related queries using LangChain, Mistral AI, and Pinecone. The chatbot leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch accurate and relevant medical information from a knowledge base, ensuring reliable responses to user queries.

🔥 Features
🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances response accuracy by retrieving medical data from Pinecone.
🧠 Mistral AI Integration: Utilizes Mistral AI for generating medical insights.
📚 LangChain Pipelines: Implements LangChain for structured data retrieval and query processing.
💾 Pinecone Vector Database: Efficiently stores and fetches relevant medical information.
🌐 Flask Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web-based interaction.
🩺 Medical Query Processing: Understands symptoms, diseases, and general health-related questions.

🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **LangChain** - For building LLM-based applications
- **Flask** - Web framework for API and app development
- **Pinecone** - Vector database for embedding storage
- **MistralAI** - Large Language Model provider
- **Hugging Face** - Pre-trained AI models and tools
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - Frontend technologies for UI/Ux

🚀 How It Works
User inputs a medical query.
The chatbot retrieves relevant medical documents using Pinecone.
LangChain processes and structures the retrieved data.
Mistral AI generates a contextual response based on the retrieved information.
The chatbot presents a reliable medical response.

📌 Usage
This chatbot is designed for medical education and awareness purposes only. It does not replace professional medical consultation.
